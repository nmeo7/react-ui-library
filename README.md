# Some good things to do

## usage

npm start

### to install this:
npm install path/to/this/react-ui-library

### then link to the ui:

## why prefer react over flutter:

you can share stuff like constants, validation logic, random util functions, business logic, data fetching and npm libraries, hooks, state management, and even ui with your other js apps.

## Misc

hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features.
reducers help avoid "prop drilling" - passing the state as props through each nested component

.grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 500px 1fr; grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; }
style="--order: 1"
